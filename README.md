# GenAI with AWS Bedrock — In Practice

A hands-on, session-driven learning repository focused on understanding and building **Generative AI systems on AWS using Amazon Bedrock**, with emphasis on **mental models, architecture decisions, and production readiness**.

This repository is part of the **aws-learning-journey-2026** organization and documents a structured, practical exploration of Generative AI on AWS — learned in public and built incrementally.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

This repository exists to:

* Learn **Amazon Bedrock the right way** — concept first, tooling second
* Move beyond demos to **real system design thinking**
* Understand **trade-offs**: cost, latency, security, accuracy
* Capture learnings in a **session-based, reusable format**

This is **not a packaged course** or certification guide.
It is a **living learning journey**, shaped by experimentation, mistakes, and architectural reasoning.

---

## 👥 Who This Is For

* Developers exploring Generative AI on AWS
* Cloud engineers moving into GenAI workloads
* Software architects designing GenAI systems
* Learners who prefer **understanding over memorization**

Basic familiarity with AWS concepts is helpful, but **no prior GenAI experience is required**.

---

## 🧠 Learning Philosophy — “In Practice”

“In practice” means:

* Mental models before APIs
* Architecture before frameworks
* Why before how
* Production thinking, even in small examples

Each session is designed to fit into **~30 minutes**, making it suitable for:

* Self-study
* Live meetups
* Team learning sessions

## 🔍 What This Repository Does *Not* Aim to Do

* ❌ Replicate Udemy or official AWS documentation
* ❌ Cover every Bedrock feature exhaustively
* ❌ Provide copy-paste production code

Instead, it focuses on **understanding how to think about GenAI systems on AWS**.

---

## 🔄 Living Repository

This repository will evolve as:

* Amazon Bedrock adds new capabilities
* GenAI best practices mature
* Real-world lessons are learned

Expect refinement, reorganization, and occasional rewrites.

---

## 📌 Disclaimer

This is a **personal learning and knowledge-sharing repository**.
It is **not official AWS training material** and does not represent Amazon or its affiliates.

---

## 🚀 Where to Start

Begin with:

👉 **`01-bedrock-mental-models/`**

Everything else builds on that foundation.

---

If you want, next I can:

* Create a **session README template**
* Write **Session 01 fully**
* Add **architecture diagrams**
* Align this repo with your **meetup slide flow**

Just tell me the next step.
