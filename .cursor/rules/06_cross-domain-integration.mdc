- Downstream applications it enables
- Related stages in learning progression

**Connection Pattern**:

```markdown
## 🔗 Related Topics

**Prerequisites**:
- [Link to prerequisite content]

**Builds Upon**:
- [Link to foundational concepts]

**Enables**:
- [Link to downstream applications]

**Cross-References**:
- [Link to related domains]
```

## Integration Requirements

When creating content, always:

1. **Identify Prerequisites**: What must learners know first?
2. **Link to Foundations**: What does this build upon?
3. **Show Applications**: What does this enable?
4. **Cross-Reference**: Connect to related domains (Development, AI/ML, Data Science, DevOps)
5. **Stage Mapping**: Which learning stages use this content?
