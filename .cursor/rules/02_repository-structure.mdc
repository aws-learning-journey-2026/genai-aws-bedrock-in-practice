## 🧭 Repository Context

**ArchitectJourney** is a comprehensive learning and reference repository for aspiring software architects. It provides:

- Structured learning roadmap from foundational programming to architectural mastery
- Reference materials for design patterns, principles, and best practices
- Practical project examples and implementation guides
- Leadership and strategic frameworks for technical decision-making

**Target Audience**: Developers → Software Architects → Lead Architects → Technology Directors

**Learning Framework**: 9-stage unified progression combining core architecture fundamentals with leadership development

### 🚨 CRITICAL: Repository Purpose & Code Separation

**This repository (`ArchitectJourney`) is EXCLUSIVELY for educational content:**

- ✅ **Educational Content Only**: Markdown documentation, learning materials, concepts, and illustrative code examples
- ✅ **Minimal Code Examples**: Code snippets in educational content should be minimal, illustrative, and focused on teaching concepts
- ❌ **NO Full Implementations**: Complete, runnable code projects are NOT stored in this repository
- ❌ **NO Code Repositories**: This repository does not contain language-specific code implementations

**Code Implementations Location:**

All full code implementations, projects, and runnable examples are stored in **separate GitHub repositories** within the same organization (`SwamysArchitectJourney-2026`):

- `Python` - Python implementations
- `CSharp` - C# and .NET projects
- `JavaScript` - JavaScript/TypeScript projects
- `Java` - Java and Spring Boot
- `Go` - Go projects
- `Cloud` - Infrastructure as Code
- `AI-ML` - AI/ML implementations

**Code Examples in Educational Content:**

When including code examples in educational content:

- ✅ Use minimal, illustrative snippets to demonstrate concepts
- ✅ Focus on teaching, not complete implementations
- ✅ Reference full implementations in separate code repositories
- ❌ Do not include complete, production-ready code
- ❌ Do not create runnable projects in this repository

## 📁 Source Materials Staging Area

**Location**: `source-material/` (at repository root, git-ignored)

**Purpose**: **Staging folder for migration** - Permanent staging area where source content is placed before review and transformation into ArchitectJourney educational content.

**Critical Workflow**:

1. **Place materials**: User places source materials (transcripts, notes, documents) in `source-material/` folder (at repository root)
2. **Review and migrate**: AI assistant reviews ALL files, identifies unique content, and migrates/transforms following Educational Content Rules
3. **Verify migration**: Confirm all unique content has been migrated to `src/01_Reference/`, `src/02_Learning/`, or `src/03_Interview-Prep/`
4. **Create verification report**: Generate migration verification report in `docs/review-reports/` with date-based naming (format: `DDMonYYYY.md`, e.g., `24Nov2025.md`)
5. **Keep source files**: After successful migration, keep source files in `source-material/` folder - user will delete manually

**Important**:

- Files in `source-material/` are **NOT required to be compliant** - they are raw source materials
- The `source-material/` folder itself is **permanent** - it's a staging area for ongoing migrations
- After migration, **keep source files** in `source-material/` folder - user will delete manually

### Learning Paths Structure

**Important**: `Learning/` folders are created **as needed** when learning content is ready to be added. Empty folders are acceptable and expected.

**Policy**:

- ✅ Create `Learning/` folder structure when you have content ready to add
- ✅ Empty folders are acceptable - they indicate planned content
- ✅ Do not create empty folder hierarchies in advance
- ✅ Add content following Educational Content Rules when ready
- ✅ Create folders progressively as learning progresses

**Current Status**: `Learning/01_Core-Architecture-Path/` and `Learning/02_Lead-Architect-Path/` exist but are empty, which is acceptable per this policy.
