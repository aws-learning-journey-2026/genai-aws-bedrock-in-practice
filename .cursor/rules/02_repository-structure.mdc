## 🧭 Repository Context

**genai-aws-bedrock-in-practice** is a practical, architecture-first learning repository for creating Generative AI solutions on AWS using Amazon Bedrock. It provides:

- Session-based learning (30-minute format) optimized for self-study and meetups
- Architecture-first approach: mental models → APIs → systems
- Production-aware content: security, cost, observability, and failure modes
- Original content focused on system design thinking, not demo-only

**Target Audience**: 
- Builders who can write basic code (any language) but want stronger GenAI system design skills on AWS
- Architects/TPMs who need clarity on trade-offs, governance, and readiness

**Learning Framework**: 9-session progressive roadmap from Bedrock foundations to production readiness

### 🚨 CRITICAL: Repository Purpose & Code Separation

**This repository (`genai-aws-bedrock-in-practice`) is EXCLUSIVELY for educational content:**

- ✅ **Educational Content Only**: Markdown documentation, session materials, concepts, and illustrative code examples
- ✅ **Minimal Code Examples**: Code snippets should be minimal, illustrative, and focused on teaching concepts
- ✅ **Minimal Runnable Labs**: The `src/` directory is reserved for minimal runnable labs/examples that add learning value
- ❌ **NO Full Implementations**: Complete, production-ready code projects are NOT stored in this repository
- ❌ **NO Code Repositories**: This repository does not contain language-specific code implementations

**Code Examples in Educational Content:**

When including code examples in educational content:

- ✅ Use minimal, illustrative snippets to demonstrate concepts
- ✅ Focus on teaching, not complete implementations
- ✅ Reference full implementations in separate code repositories if needed
- ❌ Do not include complete, production-ready code
- ❌ Do not create runnable projects beyond minimal learning examples

## 📁 Source Materials Staging Area

**Location**: `source-material/` (at repository root, git-ignored)

**Purpose**: **Staging folder for migration** - Permanent staging area where source content is placed before review and transformation into session content.

**Critical Workflow**:

1. **Place materials**: User places source materials (transcripts, notes, documents) in `source-material/` folder (at repository root)
2. **Review and migrate**: AI assistant reviews ALL files, identifies unique content, and migrates/transforms following Educational Content Rules
3. **Verify migration**: Confirm all unique content has been migrated to `docs/sessions/` or `src/` as appropriate
4. **Keep source files**: After successful migration, keep source files in `source-material/` folder - user will delete manually

**Important**:

- Files in `source-material/` are **NOT required to be compliant** - they are raw source materials
- The `source-material/` folder itself is **permanent** - it's a staging area for ongoing migrations
- After migration, **keep source files** in `source-material/` folder - user will delete manually

### Session Content Structure

**Important**: Session content is organized under `docs/sessions/` as individual markdown files following the 30-minute format.

**Policy**:

- ✅ Use `_session-template.md` as the starting point for new sessions
- ✅ Each session should produce a single primary artifact (notes, diagram, checklist, or minimal code)
- ✅ Follow the master plan structure: Objective → Core Concepts → Hands-on → Artifact
- ✅ Keep sessions focused and timeboxed to ~30 minutes

## 📞 Support & Escalation

**Questions about content placement?** → Check `docs/01_master-plan.md`

**Content too long?** → Break into multiple sessions or create multi-part structure

**Encoding issues?** → Search for, replace with Unicode equivalents

**Link broken?** → Update URLs or fix internal file references

**Structure outdated?** → Update `README.md` and `docs/01_master-plan.md` immediately
