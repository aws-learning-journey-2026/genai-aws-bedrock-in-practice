# Educational Content Rules (ArchitectJourney Knowledge Base)

**Version**: 1.1  
**Last Updated**: December 24, 2025  
**Priority**: MANDATORY - All content creation must follow these rules without exception

---

## 📋 Rule Applicability

**IMPORTANT**: These rules apply differently based on content type:

### Educational Content (`src/01_Reference/`, `src/02_Learning/`, `src/03_Interview-Prep/`)
- ✅ **File naming**: Must follow numbering conventions (01_, 02_, etc., no 00_) OR semantic names (see [File Naming Conventions](./07_file-naming-conventions.mdc))
- ✅ **Line limits**: Recommended ≤150 lines (split, don't trim)
- ✅ **YAML frontmatter**: Required for all educational content files (all 5 metadata fields)
- ✅ **Zero-copy policy**: Applies (content must be transformative)
- ✅ **File references**: Must point to existing files

### Reference Materials (`src/01_Reference/` subfolders)
- ✅ **File naming**: Semantic names preferred (e.g., `core-concepts.md`, `system-design.md`)
- ✅ **Numbering**: Optional - use only when sequence matters
- ✅ **YAML frontmatter**: Required
- ✅ **Line limits**: Recommended ≤150 lines

### Interview Preparation (`src/03_Interview-Prep/`)
- ✅ **File naming**: Semantic names preferred (e.g., `interview-overview.md`, `study-roadmap.md`)
- ✅ **Structure**: Use folders for grouping (e.g., `azure-architect/`, `devops-architect/`)
- ✅ **YAML frontmatter**: Required
- ✅ **Line limits**: Recommended ≤150 lines

### Documentation (`docs/`)
- ✅ **File naming**: Logical names (date-based for reports, descriptive for guides)
- ⚠️ **Numbering**: Optional - use only when sequence matters
- ⚠️ **YAML frontmatter**: Not required (documentation files)
- ⚠️ **Line limits**: Flexible (documentation may exceed 150 lines)

## 🚫 Zero-Copy Policy (Non-Negotiable)

**CRITICAL**: All educational content must be transformative, not reformative.

❌ **NEVER** copy text verbatim from books, articles, websites, videos, or third-party materials  
❌ **NEVER** mirror a source's outline, section order, headings, or example sequence  
❌ **NEVER** use "light paraphrasing" — must transform completely  
✅ **ALWAYS** create diagrams in Mermaid-first style with ASCII fallback (never embed copyrighted figures)  
✅ **ALWAYS** write fresh, minimal code from first principles  
✅ Brief quotations allowed ONLY with quotation marks and source citation

---

## 🔄 Transformative Workflow (Required Every Time)

**Step-by-step process for creating original educational content**:

1. **Source Intake**: Skim for intent and big ideas; don't copy notes verbatim
2. **Concept Map**: Create fresh outline with different sectioning tailored to ArchitectJourney
3. **Teach Differently**: Use new analogies, scenarios, datasets, use-cases (avoid source examples)
4. **Produce Original Artifacts**: Explanations, Mermaid diagrams (with ASCII fallback), minimal examples
5. **Cross-Link in ArchitectJourney**: Add prerequisites/builds-upon/enables across tracks
6. **Similarity Audit**: Ensure no sentences/structures resemble source
7. **Optional References**: Add "References/Inspired by" links (no copied phrasing)

**Goal**: Create transformative educational content, not just reformative. Entirely new presentation, examples, and explanations that teach the same concepts through original methods.

---

## ⏱️ 25-Minute Learning Segments

✅ **Modular content** designed for focused 25-minute sessions  
✅ **Multi-Part Structure**: Complex topics split into Part 1, Part 2, ... Part N  
✅ **One-Shot Learning**: Each segment complete and actionable within time limit  
✅ **Target Length**: 150 lines of content maximum per response

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Splitting vs. Trimming Policy

**MANDATORY APPROACH**: When content exceeds 150 lines, **ALWAYS SPLIT** into multiple parts. **NEVER TRIM** or condense content.

**Why Splitting is Required:**
- ✅ **Preserves ALL educational content** - No loss of examples, explanations, or concepts
- ✅ **Maintains learning value** - Each part remains complete and actionable
- ✅ **Better learning experience** - Learners get comprehensive coverage across parts
- ✅ **Follows 25-minute principle** - Each part fits within focused learning session

**Why Trimming is Prohibited:**
- ❌ **Loses educational content** - Examples, explanations, or concepts may be removed
- ❌ **Reduces learning value** - Condensed content may miss important details
- ❌ **Violates zero-copy policy** - If source had comprehensive content, we should preserve it
- ❌ **Poor learning experience** - Learners miss important information

**Splitting Process:**
1. **Identify logical breakpoints** - Split at natural topic boundaries (e.g., "Foundation" → "Implementation" → "Advanced")
2. **Preserve all content** - Move content to appropriate part, don't delete
3. **Maintain completeness** - Each part should be self-contained and complete
4. **Use semantic naming** - Name files by their content concept (e.g., `fundamentals.md`, `advanced.md`). See [File Naming Conventions](./07_file-naming-conventions.mdc) for details.
5. **Update references** - Update all file references after splitting

**Example**: If a file has 300 lines covering "Factory Pattern Fundamentals" and "Factory Pattern Advanced", split into:
- `factory-pattern-fundamentals.md` (Fundamentals - 150 lines)
- `factory-pattern-advanced.md` (Advanced - 150 lines)

**Or** (if sequence matters):
- `01_factory-pattern-fundamentals.md` (Fundamentals - 150 lines)
- `02_factory-pattern-advanced.md` (Advanced - 150 lines)

**NOT**: Condense to 150 lines by removing examples or explanations.

## 📋 Required Content Structure

### 5 Required ArchitectJourney Metadata Fields

Every educational content file MUST include:

```yaml
---
learning_level: "Beginner" | "Intermediate" | "Advanced"
prerequisites: ["required knowledge", "prior concepts"]
estimated_time: "25 minutes"  # Standard, adjust if needed
learning_objectives:
  - "Specific, measurable outcome 1"
  - "Specific, measurable outcome 2"
related_topics:
  prerequisites: ["../prerequisite-content/"]
  builds_upon: ["../foundational-content/"]
  enables: ["../advanced-content/"]
  cross_refs: ["../related-domains/"]
---
```

### Numbering Convention

✅ **ALWAYS** use zero-padded numeric prefixes starting at `01_`  
❌ **NEVER** use `00_` prefixes - **NO EXCEPTIONS**  
✅ Keep numbering stable; add new numbers rather than renumbering widely  
✅ Use hyphens for multi-word names: `01_Software-Design-Principles/`

**CRITICAL**: This rule applies to **ALL files** in the repository:
- ✅ Educational content files (`01_Reference/`, `02_Learning/`)
- ✅ Documentation files (`docs/`)
- ✅ Any numbered files anywhere in the repository
- ❌ **NO EXCEPTIONS** - `00_` is NEVER allowed, even for meta/documentation files

**Why This Rule Exists**:
- Maintains consistent numbering across the repository
- Prevents confusion about file ordering
- Ensures predictable file organization
- `01_` clearly indicates the first item, `00_` is ambiguous

### Learning Order Requirements (CRITICAL)

**CRITICAL**: File numbering MUST reflect logical learning dependencies, not arbitrary ordering.

**Standard OOP Learning Progression** (Reference/01_Development/01_Software-Design-Principles/):

1. **01**: OOP Introduction - Understanding the paradigm
2. **02**: Classes and Objects - Core building blocks
3. **03**: Encapsulation and Abstraction - Data protection
4. **04**: Inheritance and Polymorphism - Code reuse (fundamental OOP pillar)
5. **05**: Composition and Interfaces - Advanced patterns (compares with inheritance)
6. **06**: UML Class Relationships - Visualizing relationships

**Why This Order Matters**:

- Inheritance (04) must come BEFORE Composition (05) because Composition discusses "favor composition over inheritance" - learners need to understand inheritance first
- Inheritance is a fundamental OOP pillar; Composition is an alternative/comparison
- UML (06) comes last as it visualizes all previous concepts

**When Creating New Content**:

- ✅ Verify prerequisites are numbered BEFORE the new content
- ✅ Check that "enables" relationships point to content numbered AFTER
- ✅ Ensure learning dependencies match file numbering order
- ❌ NEVER place content that depends on later-numbered files

### File Naming Convention for Split Files

**⚠️ DEPRECATED**: The `Part1-A`, `Part1-B` pattern is deprecated. See [File Naming Conventions](./07_file-naming-conventions.mdc) for the new standard.

**NEW STANDARD**: Use semantic names that describe the content concept.

**When splitting files**:
1. **Identify distinct concepts** - Split at natural topic boundaries
2. **Use semantic names** - Name files by their content, not by sequence
3. **Use folders for structure** - When content groups naturally, use folders

**Examples** (New Standard):
- ✅ `fundamentals.md`, `advanced.md` (semantic names)
- ✅ `core-concepts.md`, `system-design.md` (semantic names)
- ✅ `01_fundamentals.md`, `02_advanced.md` (only if sequence matters)

**Examples** (Old Pattern - Deprecated):
- ❌ `Topic-Part1-A.md` (avoid - encodes hierarchy in filename)
- ❌ `Topic-Part1-B.md` (avoid - encodes hierarchy in filename)
- ❌ `Topic-Part1-B-A.md` (avoid - brittle and confusing)

**Migration**: Existing files using `Part1-A` patterns remain for backward compatibility, but all new content must use semantic names. See [File Naming Conventions](./07_file-naming-conventions.mdc) for details.

---

## 🎓 Educational Excellence Standards

All content must demonstrate:

- ✅ **Clear objectives and outcomes**: Specific, measurable learning goals
- ✅ **Progressive scaffolding**: Foundations → Practice → Pitfalls → Next Steps
- ✅ **Original examples, datasets, and exercises**: Never reuse source examples
- ✅ **Mermaid-first visuals**: Primary Mermaid diagrams with ASCII fallback for compatibility
- ✅ **Cross-references across tracks**: Development, AI/ML, Data Science, DevOps

---

## ✅ Quality Gate Questions (Before Publishing)

**Self-check before finalizing any educational content**:

1. ✅ Is this explanation clearer than the source material?
2. ✅ Does this fit naturally in the learning progression?
3. ✅ Would a learner understand this without the original source?
4. ✅ Are the examples relevant and practical?
5. ✅ Does this content add educational value beyond the reference?
6. ✅ Is this content within 150 lines for effective delivery?

---

## 📁 Content Placement Policy

✅ `Reference/` is EXCLUSIVELY for learning content  
❌ Never mix planning materials, workflow docs, or meta content  
✅ Group logically by learning progression, not source structure  
✅ Place content in correct domain folder (Development/AI-ML/Data-Science/DevOps)

### 🚨 CRITICAL: Code Examples Policy

**This repository is EXCLUSIVELY for educational content. Code implementations are in separate repositories.**

**Code Examples in Educational Content:**

- ✅ **Minimal, Illustrative Snippets**: Code examples should be minimal and focused on teaching concepts
- ✅ **Teaching-Focused**: Code should demonstrate principles, patterns, or concepts, not provide complete implementations
- ✅ **Reference Full Code**: Link to full implementations in separate code repositories (Python, CSharp, JavaScript, etc.)
- ❌ **NO Full Implementations**: Do not include complete, runnable code projects in this repository
- ❌ **NO Production Code**: Do not include production-ready, deployable code in educational content
- ❌ **NO Code Repositories**: All full code implementations belong in separate GitHub repositories within the organization

**When Creating Code Examples:**

1. **Keep it minimal**: Show only the essential code needed to illustrate the concept
2. **Add comments**: Explain what the code demonstrates
3. **Link to full code**: Reference the separate code repository where full implementation exists
4. **Focus on learning**: Code should teach, not provide complete solutions

**Example Structure:**

```markdown
## Factory Pattern Example

Here's a minimal example demonstrating the Factory Pattern:

```python
# Minimal illustrative example
class ProductFactory:
    def create_product(self, product_type):
        if product_type == "A":
            return ProductA()
        return ProductB()
```

> **Full Implementation**: See complete Factory Pattern implementation in [Python repository](https://github.com/SwamysArchitectJourney-2026/Python/tree/main/design-patterns/factory)
```

### Source Materials Staging Area

**Location**: `source-material/` (at repository root, git-ignored)

**Purpose**: **Staging folder for migration** - Temporary staging area where source content is placed before review and transformation into ArchitectJourney educational content.

**Critical Workflow**:

1. **Place materials**: User places source materials (transcripts, notes, documents) in `source-material/` folder
2. **Review and migrate**: AI assistant reviews content, identifies unique topics, and migrates/transforms following Educational Content Rules
3. **Verify migration**: Confirm all unique content has been migrated to `Reference/` or `Learning/`
4. **Keep source files**: After successful migration, keep source files in `source-material/` folder - user will delete manually

**Important Notes**:

- ⚠️ **Files in `source-material/` are NOT required to be compliant** - this is a staging area for raw source content
- ❌ **NEVER MODIFY files in `source-material/`** - AI assistants must ONLY READ these files for migration purposes, never edit, format, or change them
- ✅ **Review rules apply DURING transformation** - ensure transformation process follows all Educational Content Rules
- ✅ **When user requests migration**: Review ALL files in `source-material/`, identify unique content, and migrate following Educational Content Rules
- ✅ Files here will be transformed following Educational Content Rules into compliant content
- ✅ After transformation, create compliant content in `Reference/` or `Learning/`
- ✅ **After successful migration**: Keep source files in `source-material/` folder - user will delete manually
- ❌ **Never commit `source-material/` content** - it's git-ignored for a reason
- ✅ **Keep `source-material/` folder** - it's a permanent staging area for future migrations

**Transformation Workflow** (Using CoT, ReAct, and Reasoning):

**🚨 CRITICAL**: This workflow uses **THE EXACT SAME 7-CATEGORY REVIEW CHECKLIST** as the Comprehensive Content Review Process. Every file created during migration MUST pass all review checks before being considered complete.

1. **OBSERVE**: Place source materials (transcripts, notes, etc.) in `source-material/` (at repository root)
   - Scan and catalog source content
   - Identify key concepts and learning objectives
   - Understand source structure and dependencies

2. **ANALYZE**: Apply review rules DURING transformation using CoT/ReAct methodology:
   - **Reason through transformation**: Break down source content into logical learning segments
   - **Apply 7-category review checklist while transforming**:
     - Verify YAML frontmatter structure as you create it
     - Ensure content is transformative (not copied) during transformation
     - **Check line count as you build content (≤ 150 lines) - SPLIT if exceeds, NEVER TRIM**
     - Validate file naming conventions during creation
     - Verify file references as you add them
     - Ensure zero-copy policy compliance during transformation
     - Confirm learning progression logic as you structure content
     - **Preserve ALL educational content through splitting, not condensing**
   - **Use Chain-of-Thought**: Think through each transformation step explicitly
   - **Apply Reasoning**: Make logical decisions about content structure, examples, and explanations

3. **REASON**: Create new educational content in appropriate `01_Reference/`, `02_Learning/`, or `03_Interview-Prep/` folders
   - Apply logical reasoning to determine correct placement
   - Ensure learning dependencies are properly structured
   - Verify content flow and progression

4. **VERIFY**: Review final content using comprehensive review checklist before committing
   - Cross-check all requirements
   - Validate compliance with all rules
   - Confirm zero-copy policy adherence
   - **Create migration verification report** in `docs/review-reports/` with date-based naming (e.g., `24Nov2025.md`)

5. **ACT**: After successful migration and verification:
   - Keep source files in `source-material/` folder - user will delete manually
   - Save migration verification report to `docs/review-reports/` with date-based filename

**Compliance Requirements**:
- ❌ `source-material/` files: **NO compliance required** (staging area - raw source content)
- ✅ **Transformation process**: **MUST follow review rules** (apply checklist during transformation)
- ✅ `01_Reference/` files: **FULL compliance required** (final content - must pass all review checks)
- ✅ `02_Learning/` files: **FULL compliance required** (final content - must pass all review checks)
- ✅ `03_Interview-Prep/` files: **FULL compliance required** (final content - must pass all review checks)

**Review During Migration** (Using CoT, ReAct, and Reasoning):

- **OBSERVE**: Systematically analyze source content before transformation
- **ANALYZE**: Apply the 7-category Individual File Review Checklist **while transforming** content
  - Use Chain-of-Thought to break down transformation into logical steps
  - Apply ReAct methodology: Observe → Analyze → Reason → Verify → Act
  - Use systematic reasoning to make transformation decisions
- **REASON**: Make logical decisions about:
  - Content structure and organization
  - Example selection and creation
  - Learning progression and dependencies
  - File naming and references
- **VERIFY**: Don't wait until after migration - catch issues during the transformation process
  - Verify compliance at each step: YAML structure, line count, naming, references, zero-copy policy
  - Cross-check findings as you transform
- **ACT**: Final review after migration confirms all requirements are met

**🚨 CRITICAL RULE ALIGNMENT**: Migration and Review use **THE EXACT SAME RULES AND CHECKLIST**. The 7-category Individual File Review Checklist (YAML Frontmatter, Content Structure, File Naming, File References, Content Quality, Zero-Copy Policy, Learning Progression) MUST be applied during migration/transformation, not just during review. The same CoT, ReAct, and Reasoning methodology used for reviews MUST be applied during migration/transformation.

### Learning Paths Creation Policy

**Important**: `Learning/` folder structure is created **as needed** when content is ready.

**Policy**:
- ✅ Create `Learning/` folders when you have compliant content ready to add
- ✅ Empty folders are acceptable - they indicate planned content areas
- ❌ Do not create extensive empty folder hierarchies in advance
- ✅ Add content progressively following Educational Content Rules
- ✅ Create folder structure incrementally as learning content is developed

**Rationale**: This prevents creating empty structures that may never be populated, while allowing for planned learning paths to be established when content is ready.

## 🔗 File Reference Requirements (CRITICAL)

### Mandatory Practices

**CRITICAL**: All file references MUST point to existing files or be clearly marked as planned content.

### When Creating File References

1. ✅ **Verify file exists** before adding reference
2. ✅ **Use exact file names** - match actual file names exactly (including all part suffixes)
3. ✅ **Test references** - run `.\tools\psscripts\Validate-FileReferences.ps1` after adding references
4. ✅ **Update after splitting** - when splitting files, update ALL references to that file immediately

### When Splitting Files

**CRITICAL WORKFLOW**:

1. Create new part files
2. **IMMEDIATELY** run: `.\tools\psscripts\Validate-FileReferences.ps1` to find all references
3. Update ALL references to point to correct part files
4. Run validation again to verify
5. Test navigation manually

### Reference Patterns

- **Prerequisites/Builds Upon**: Use first part (`-Part1-Part1.md`) or specific part if needed
- **Enables**: Can reference any part, typically next part in sequence
- **Planned Content**: References to files that don't exist yet are acceptable IF clearly marked as planned

### Validation Checklist

Before committing:
- [ ] Run `.\tools\psscripts\Validate-FileReferences.ps1`
- [ ] All references point to existing files (or are clearly planned)
- [ ] Navigation links work in markdown preview
- [ ] No broken references remain

---

## 🎯 Interview Preparation Content Guidelines

**CRITICAL**: All interview preparation content in `03_Interview-Prep/` must be **generic and company-agnostic**.

### Generic Content Policy

❌ **NEVER** include company-specific names (Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Meta, etc.)  
❌ **NEVER** reference company-specific frameworks by name (e.g., "Amazon Leadership Principles")  
❌ **NEVER** create company-specific interview scripts or answers  
✅ **ALWAYS** use generic descriptions (e.g., "Leadership Principles", "Clarity–Energy–Success model")  
✅ **ALWAYS** frame content for broad applicability across organizations  
✅ **ALWAYS** focus on universal principles and practices  

**Rationale**: Interview prep content should be applicable to any organization, not tied to specific companies. This makes the content more valuable and reusable.

**Examples of Generic Framing**:
- ❌ "Amazon Leadership Principles" → ✅ "Leadership Principles (ownership, customer focus, bias for action)"
- ❌ "Microsoft's Clarity–Energy–Success model" → ✅ "Clarity–Energy–Success model (bringing clarity, energizing teams, driving success)"
- ❌ "For Amazon, AWS roles" → ✅ "For high-pressure TPM roles, customer-obsessed organizations"
- ❌ "For Google, Meta, Stripe, Uber" → ✅ "For deep-tech companies, innovation-focused organizations"

**When Creating Interview Prep Content**:
1. Focus on universal principles and practices
2. Use generic organizational types (product companies, startups, enterprise organizations)
3. Reference frameworks by their concepts, not company names
4. Make content applicable to any similar organization

---

## 🔍 Comprehensive Content Review Process

**MANDATORY**: All content in `01_Reference/`, `02_Learning/`, and `03_Interview-Prep/` folders must undergo comprehensive review using CoT (Chain-of-Thought), ReAct (Reasoning + Acting), and systematic reasoning.

**🚨 CRITICAL RULE ALIGNMENT**: Migration and Review use **THE EXACT SAME RULES AND CHECKLIST**. The 7-category Individual File Review Checklist MUST be applied during migration/transformation, not just during review. This ensures all content is compliant from the moment it's created.

### Review Request Protocol

**When a review is REQUESTED**:

- ✅ **MANDATORY**: Review EACH AND EVERY file individually - no file should be skipped
- ✅ **MANDATORY**: Open and examine every file in the specified scope
- ✅ **MANDATORY**: Apply the 7-category review checklist to every single file
- ❌ **NEVER**: Skip files, assume compliance, or review only a sample
- ❌ **NEVER**: Review only files that "look problematic" - review ALL files

**Scope of Review**:
- If reviewing `01_Reference/` folder: Review ALL files in `01_Reference/`
- If reviewing `02_Learning/` folder: Review ALL files in `02_Learning/`
- If reviewing `03_Interview-Prep/` folder: Review ALL files in `03_Interview-Prep/`
- If reviewing a specific subfolder: Review ALL files in that subfolder
- If reviewing specific files: Review each requested file individually

### Review Methodology

**Use CoT, ReAct, and Reasoning for every review**:

1. **OBSERVE**: Systematically scan and catalog all files
   - List every file in the review scope
   - No file should be excluded or skipped
2. **ANALYZE**: Review each file individually with deep analysis
   - Open and examine every file
   - Apply review checklist to each file
3. **REASON**: Apply logical reasoning to identify issues and patterns
4. **VERIFY**: Cross-check findings and validate compliance
5. **ACT**: Document findings and update content as needed

### Individual File Review Checklist

### Deep Dive Review Process

**When performing comprehensive review**:

1. **Systematic File Scanning**
   ```powershell
   # Get all files to review
   Get-ChildItem "src\01_Reference" -Recurse -Filter "*.md" | 
       Where-Object { $_.Name -ne "README.md" }
   ```

2. **Individual File Analysis**
   - Open each file
   - Check YAML frontmatter structure
   - Verify all metadata fields
   - Count lines (must be ≤ 150)
   - Check file naming conventions
   - Validate all file references
   - Review content quality indicators

3. **Reference Validation**
   ```powershell
   # Run reference validation
   .\tools\psscripts\Validate-FileReferences.ps1
   ```

4. **Content Quality Analysis**
   - Check for code examples
   - Check for diagrams (Mermaid/ASCII)
   - Check for headings
   - Check for suspicious patterns
   - Verify zero-copy compliance

5. **Documentation**
   - Document all findings
   - Create issue list with file paths
   - Prioritize issues (critical vs. warnings)
   - Track fixes and verification

### Review Tools

**Use these tools for comprehensive review**:

- `.\tools\psscripts\Comprehensive-ReferenceReview.ps1` - Deep dive review with CoT/ReAct methodology
- `.\tools\psscripts\Validate-FileReferences.ps1` - File reference validation
- `.\tools\psscripts\Review-EducationalContent.ps1` - General compliance review

### Review Frequency

- **Before committing**: Review all modified files
- **After splitting files**: Review all affected files and references
- **Periodic audits**: Comprehensive review of entire `01_Reference/` folder
- **After major changes**: Full review of affected sections

### Review Documentation

**Always document review findings**:

- Create review reports with findings
- List all issues found (with file paths)
- Track compliance statistics
- Document fixes applied
- Verify fixes after remediation
