## Why This Session

Before tools, you need clarity. This session eliminates confusion about what Bedrock is and how to think about it.

Most failures with Generative AI on AWS happen **before code is written**:

* Teams confuse Bedrock with SageMaker
* Developers treat LLMs like deterministic APIs
* Architects design systems without understanding token costs or model behavior

Without the right mental model, every design decision downstream is flawed. This session establishes the conceptual foundation required for **all subsequent sessions**.

## Agenda

### 1. Generative AI on AWS: The Big Picture

* AWS AI/ML service landscape
* Where Bedrock fits: High-level APIs → Bedrock → SageMaker
* Bedrock vs OpenAI vs Azure OpenAI vs SageMaker

### 2. The AI Hierarchy (Minimal Mental Model)

* Artificial Intelligence → Machine Learning → Neural Networks → Deep Learning → Generative AI → Foundation Models → Amazon Bedrock
* Essential concepts and terminology
* What Bedrock abstracts away (and why it matters)

### 3. Foundation Models & Trade-offs

* What foundation models are (and aren't)
* Text, chat, image, embeddings
* Cost, latency, quality, determinism
* Generality vs. control trade-offs

### 4. What Amazon Bedrock Actually Is (and Isn't)

* Managed foundation model platform
* Serverless inference, model choice, enterprise controls
* What Bedrock is NOT (common misconceptions)
* The "Power Grid" analogy

### 5. Key Vocabulary & Wrap-up

* Essential terms: Generative AI, Foundation Model, Inference, Token, Prompt, Bedrock
* Architecture considerations
* Deliverable: Create your one-page mental model note + glossary
