# Session 01: Bedrock Mental Models & GenAI Foundations (Index)

This session is split into focused modules to stay within the 30-minute format and keep each concept boundary clean.

* **Event URL:** <https://www.meetup.com/dot-net-learners-house-hyderabad/events/312511436>
* **Duration:** ~30 minutes (combined)
* **Type:** Conceptual (mental models first, tooling later)
* **Deliverable:** One-page *Bedrock Mental Model* note + glossary

---

## Modules

1. [Core Mental Models](core-mental-models.md)
2. [Tokens](tokens.md)
3. [Terminology & Scope](terminology-and-scope.md)
4. [Applied Reasoning & Artifact](applied-reasoning-and-artifact.md)

## Output Artifact

After completing the modules, you should have a one-page note that answers:

* What Bedrock is (and is not)
* The minimal hierarchy you need as a Bedrock user
* The core terms you’ll use in later sessions (model, prompt, tokens, inference)
* The first “design reflexes” for cost, variability, and safety
